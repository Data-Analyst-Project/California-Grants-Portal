Through regional competitions within three geographic regions (Northern Region, Bay Area Region, Central and Imperial Valley Region) pursuant to California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 25 CCR 8404 (a) (3); and  2. Through a noncompetitive process for Rapid Re-Housing (RR) activities.  Continuum of Care Allocation:CoCs within this allocation have at least one city or county that receives ESG funds directly from HUD. Within the CoC Allocation, Administrative Entities (AEs) are selected by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to administer an allocation of funds provided through a formula for their service area. These AEs must be local governments of ESG Entitlement Areas and must commit to administering ESG funds in collaboration with their CoC throughout their CoC Service Area, including ensuring access to ESG funds by households living in Nonentitlement Areas. A minimum of 40 percent of each AE Allocation must be used for Rapid Rehousing activities.  Eligible Applicants and Eligible Areas to Be Served:The Department subgrants its funding to subrecipients in Continuum of Care (CoC) service areas that have at least one jurisdiction that does not receive ESG funds directly from HUD (“Nonentitlement”). In the CoC Allocation, local governmental entities are eligible subrecipients, who in turn select homeless service providers to receive the funds. In the Balance of State Allocation, private nonprofit organizations or units of general purpose local government are eligible subrecipients that receive ESG funds directly from the Department.  State ESG funded activities may serve the entire service area of the CoC, but must serve Nonentitlement areas within the service area. For a list of CoC Service Areas eligible to participate in the State’s ESG program, refer to Appendix A of the current NOFA.","Nonprofit; Public Agency",,"ESG funds eligible units of local governments and non-profit organizations, primarily in non-entitlement areas in California.",Federal,,100%,,"$12,600,000","Between 50 and 60","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.","Advances & Reimbursement(s)","Assistance Type and Terms:  HCD distributes federal Emergency Solutions Grant funds to eligible subrecipients with one- or two-year grants.","2022-06-08 07:00:00","2022-07-26 09:00:00",24-months,"November 2022",,https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-funding/active-funding/esg.shtml,https://www.hcd.ca.gov,https://www.hcd.ca.gov/i-am/sub_email.shtml,,"name: Connie Mallavia, Program Manager, Federal Branch (PDI no longer writes our NOFAs or Applications); email: connie.mallavia@hcd.ca.gov; tel: 1-916-890-6192;",

This program seeks to create more-resilient forest landscapes, reduce wildfire risk, accelerate recovery from recent wildfires and supports projects that address these strategies.  California’s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan identifies three goals that are strongly aligned with the WIP: healthy and resilient natural places, safe communities, and sustainable economies. Both plans also stress the importance of climate resiliency, regionally tailored solutions, the linkages between ecological and economic health, the importance of low-intensity fire, and the need to work strategically across land ownership boundaries. This grant program aims to support projects with the following, additional focal areas: multi-benefit projects, landscape-scale projects, high-impact projects, and wildfire recovery.  To be eligible to receive a grant award from the SNC under this program, projects must meet all of the following criteria: be located within or provide services to the Sierra Nevada Region as defined by current SNC governing legislation; be consistent with the SNC mission and program areas as defined in the SNC Strategic Plan; be consistent with the requirements of the funding source and budget provisions, result in a clear, demonstrable, and enduring public benefit; and meet all California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements, as applicable.  Consistent with provisions of the program funding and objectives of the proposed project, the SNC may give favorable consideration to projects which: involve California Native American tribes, including grants directly to tribal entities or those to tribal or other entities which provide meaningful engagement with and support to tribal partners; were developed under the Regional Forest and Fire Capacity program; address fire recovery objectives; directly benefit severely disadvantaged  or disadvantaged communities; engage a workforce development effort, including but not limited to tribal workforce programs, California Conservation Corps, or other training programs; employ a collaborative, community-led approach in project development or implementation and enable the equitable geographic distribution of SNC resources.   Proposals are developed in conjunction with SNC. To initiate consideration of a project, an applicant must contact the appropriate SNC Area Representative (AR) and the AR will work with the applicant to determine if the project meets SNC criteria. If SNC determines consideration of the project, a concept proposal form will be shared with the applicant. This proposal process involves Concept and Full Proposal phases. Concept Proposals are due July 29. A site visit may be conducted for eligible implementation projects. If invited to submit, Full Proposals are due October 28.

CDFA will make approximately $12.2 million (40% of $30.4 million) available for the AMMP, which includes an allocation for technical assistance grants under AB 2377. The Dairy Digester Research and Development Program (DDRDP) will have approximately $18.2 million available to support digesters that reduce methane emissions from dairy operations.  CDFA will fund up to 100% of the total project cost with a maximum grant award of $750,000 per project. Matching funds are strongly encouraged.  The maximum project term is two (2) years. Grant funds cannot be expended before January 1, 2023, or after December 31, 2024. CDFA may offer an award different than the amount requested.  The project site must be located on a commercial California dairy or livestock operation. Individuals receiving grant award funds must be located in California with a physical California business address. A dairy operation is defined as an entity that operates a dairy herd, which produces milk or cream commercially, and whose bulk milk or bulk cream is received or handled by any distributor, manufacturer, or any nonprofit cooperative association of dairy producers. A livestock operation is defined as an entity raising farm animals such ascattle, poultry, goats, sheep, swine, and horses. AMMP supports several project types for which there are methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. To be eligible, the current baselinemanure management practices must include the anaerobic decomposition of volatile solids stored in a lagoon or other predominantly liquid anaerobic environment. Methane is produced when volatile manure solids are stored in wet, anaerobic conditions; consequently, conditions that lead to methane production must currently exist at a dairy or livestock operation in order for methane emission reductions to be achieved through an AMMP project.  While solid separation or conversion from flush to dry scrape manure collection can be a critical component of an AMMP project, these practices are not considered to be stand-alone projects because they relate only to how manure is separated or collected. In order to calculate GHG emissions and emission reductions, it is also necessary to identify how the separated or collected manure volatile solids will be treated and/or stored (e.g., open solar drying, composting in vessel). Storage or further treatment will always take place with separated orcollected solids, and applicants are required to identify what this will be. The storage or further treatment of the collected solids produces methane to varying degrees, as determined by the Methane Conversion Factor (MCF) for each practice. Applicants should use the definitions provided to determine which practice most closely describes how they will manage separated or scraped manure volatile solids.  For more information, please refer to the 2022 AMMP Request for Grant Applications.","Business; Individual; Nonprofit; Tribal Government","The project site must be located on a commercial California dairy or livestock operation.A dairy operation is defined as an entity that operates a dairy herd, produces milk or cream commercially, and whose bulk milk or bulk cream is received or handled by any distributor, manufacturer, or any nonprofit cooperative association of dairy producers.

Applicants shall present an innovative proposal that includes a self-identified prioritized objective that complements, augments, or strengthens a community’s efforts to address and end family homelessness.   ","BackgroundThe California Interagency Council on Homelessness (Cal ICH) was created in 2017 to oversee the implementation of Housing First policies, guidelines, and regulations to reduce the prevalence and duration of homelessness in California. The Council's mission is to develop policies and to identify and coordinate resources, benefits, and services to prevent and work toward ending homelessness in California.Eligible Applicants• Local Jurisdiction – means a city, including a charter city, a county, including a charter county, or a city and county, including a charter city and county.• Continuum of Care – as defined in Section 578.3 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Only FHC-1 grantees are eligible to compete for FHC-2.  Shared Objective of These Funds  1. FHC-1 Objective Cal ICH will fund innovative applications that accelerate efforts by local jurisdictions and continuums of care to address and end family homelessness by making families’ experiences of homelessness rare, brief, and one-time.• Rare: Prevented whenever possible• Brief: Ended quickly whenever it does occur through a focus on Housing First approaches and housing outcomes  • One-time: Ended successfully the first time  An innovative proposal complements, augments, or strengthens a community’s efforts to address and end family homelessness. Innovative is relative to a community’s existing efforts (if any); it does not necessarily mean a paradigm shift. For example, to reduce the length of time a household remains homeless and lessen potential returns to homelessness, a community may seek to augment existing housing navigation efforts specifically for family households with dependent minors. 2. Self-Identified, Prioritized ObjectiveApplicants shall present an innovative proposal that includes a self-identified prioritized objective that aligns with the FHC-1 objective (i.e., rare, brief, and / or one-time). For example, one proposal may focus on making an impact on “rare” and “brief” whereas another proposal focuses primarily on “one-time.” Proposals will be scored on the likelihood of making a strong impact upon their self-identified, prioritized objective.","Public Agency","Eligible Applicants• Local Jurisdiction – means a city, including a charter city, a county, including a charter county, or a city and county, including a charter city and county.• Continuum of Care – as defined in Section 578.3 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.",,State,"Authority  Under Chapter 8 of Part 1 of Division 31 of the California Health and Safety Code(sections 50255 et seq.), the Family Homelessness Challenge Grant (FHC-1) was established for the purpose of providing one-time grants and technical assistance to local jurisdictions and continuums of care to address and end family homelessness.","Not Required",,"$15,000,000","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.",Advance(s),,"2022-03-03 08:00:00","2022-04-30 17:00:00",6/30/2026,6/29/2022,"url: https://www.cognitoforms.com/californiainteragencycouncilonhomelessness/familyhomelessnesschallengegrantround1rfa;",https://bcsh.ca.gov/calich/documents/fhc_rfa.pdf,https://bcsh.ca.gov/calich/,https://bcsh.ca.gov/calich/fhc_program.html,https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_l4HiFaUCQpmo4glF8HxgLQ,"name: FHC-1 Contract Manager; email: HHAP@bcsh.ca.gov; tel: 1-916-651-2895;","[{""fiscalYear"":""2021-2022"",""applicationsSubmitted"":""32""}]"

Funds for the CCHE came from Proposition 40, the California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and Coastal Protection Act of 2002.  $122 million in grants were distributed competitively for the acquisition, restoration, preservation, and interpretation of historical and cultural resources.  In 2013, AB 482 (Atkins) authorized the creation of a specified competitive grant program administered by CCHE to support small capital projects in museums.  On September 23, 2018, Senate Bill (SB) 1493 was approved and expanded the museum grant program’s project focus to include exhibits, educational programs, outreach programs, public programs, curriculum, marketing, and collections care in museums.

Eligible Projects:  Eligible projects include program projects, small capital projects, or a combination of a program and related capital elements.  All projects must support at least one of the following to be eligible: exhibits, educational programs, outreach programs, public programs, curriculum, marketing, collections care, and small capital projects.  Selection Process:  Step 1: Applicants submit Project Proposals through the System for Online Application Review (SOAR).  Step 2: Field visits are conducted for the most competitive projects.  Step 3: Applicants selected to further compete submit additional documentation.  Documentation is evaluated with the most competitive applicants being recommended for funding.  In evaluating projects, scores are used to determine initial rankings and facilitate discussions for each proposal. To achieve equitable distribution of funds, the State may consider additional factors including, but not limited to, geographic distribution of funds, previous grant performance, disadvantaged community status, and feasibility to accept partial funding.

The Budget Act of 2021 (Senate Bill 129) established the Women’s Recovery Response to provide local assistance with $5 million in one-time funds.

These centers provide wrap-around services and assist victims who are typically part of unserved and underserved communities.","The Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Grant funds organizations that operate throughout California to provide survivors of violent crime access to mental health or social services that may not be accessible for them through existing avenues. The TRC model offers wrap-around clinical services and cost-effective solutions for under- or unserved survivors and includes assertive outreach, clinical case management, assistance with law enforcement, referral to community resources and trauma-informed treatment. TRCs are meant to meet the victim where they are and serve each victim specific to his/her/their needs. Grant planning is not an eligible activity.   Funding for TRCs varies each year with $2,000,000 from the Restitution Fund and a percentage of savings from the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund (SNSF) that varies annually. SNSF totals have increased from $3.9 million in 2016 to $12.1 million in 2020. CalVCB typically receives 10-20 applications and awards 6-8 TRC grants. Individual awards vary by number of passing applications, funds available, and the amount requested to fund the TRC. Grants are for two fiscal years at a time, and TRCs may re-apply at the end of their awarded grant period to avoid a lapse in funding.   Each year, CalVCB posts a Notice of Funds Available (NOFA) that instructs how interested applicants may apply and what each application should include. Questions about the NOFA may be submitted and will receive a timely response within the application deadline. Due dates for the application will be included in the NOFA posting.   TRCs must follow the May 2017 edition of the evidence-informed model of care developed by the State Pilot TRC, including a multidisciplinary staff that includes a Program Director, Psychologist, Psychiatrist and a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) or Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). Each TRC is expected to invoice monthly, submit data reports monthly and maintain records to fulfill site visit and/or audit requirements.   Typical expenses for TRCs include:   • Salary and benefits for personnel • Operating expenses related to direct services such as rent, insurance, utilities, postage, telephone service, internet costs, subcontractors, printed outreach materials, and other costs approved by the board• Emergency funds to help clients with nominal crime-related costs to meet the immediate needs of TRC clients such as transportation, childcare, food, emergency shelter, or clothing • Costs associated with community outreach events and activities• In-state training for the provision of trauma-informed evidence-based and evidence-informed practices as outlined in the grant application and approved in advance • Indirect costs (your organization must have a pre-existing cost rate agreement)  The CalVCB Board reviews recommendations made and approves or denies the funding recommendation. Upon Board approval, grantees will be notified of their grant award, with all applicants receiving notification of results. ","Business; Individual; Nonprofit; Public Agency; Tribal Government",,Statewide,State,"Government Code sections 13963.1 and 13963.2","Not Required",,"$2,000,000","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.",Reimbursement(s),,"2022-01-03 19:00:00","2022-02-02 14:00:00","7/1/2022 - 6/30/2024","March 2022","email: Grants@victims.ca.gov;",https://victims.ca.gov/board/grant-opportunities/,https://victims.ca.gov/,,,"email: Grants@victims.ca.gov; tel: 1-916-491-3553;","[{""fiscalYear"":""2021-2022"",""applicationsSubmitted"":""17""}]"

The Sierra Nevada Conservancy (SNC) is taking significant steps to fund projects that can reduce wildfire risks and respond to recent wildfire damage. This program seeks to create more-resilient forest landscapes, reduce wildfire risk, and accelerate recovery from recent wildfires.  California’s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan identifies three goals that are strongly aligned with the WIP: healthy and resilient natural places, safe communities, and sustainable economies. Both plans also stress the importance of climate resiliency, regionally tailored solutions, the linkages between ecological and economic health, the importance of low-intensity fire, and the need to work strategically across land ownership boundaries. This grant program aims to support projects with the following, additional focal areas: multi-benefit projects, landscape-scale projects, high-impact projects, wildfire recovery, and projects developed under the Regional Forest and Fire Capacity program.  To be eligible to receive a grant award from the SNC under this program, projects must meet all of the following criteria:  1)    Be located within or provide services to the Sierra Nevada Region as defined by current SNC governing legislation  2)    Be consistent with the SNC mission and program areas as defined in the SNC Strategic Plan.  3)    Be consistent with the requirements of the funding source and budget provisions.  4)    Be complete by 01/01/2028.  5)    Result in a clear, demonstrable, and enduring public benefit  6)    Meet all California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements, as applicable.  Consistent with provisions of the program funding and objectives of the proposed project, the SNC may give favorable consideration to projects which involve California Native American tribes; were developed under the Regional Forest and Fire Capacity program; address fire recovery objectives; directly benefit severely disadvantaged (SDAC) or disadvantage (DAC) communities; engage a workforce development effort, including but not limited to tribal workforce programs, California Conservation Corps, or other training programs; employ a collaborative approach in project development or implementation; leverage private, federal, or local resources; or enable the equitable geographic distribution of SNC resources.  Application Process:  Proposals are developed in conjunction with SNC. To initiate consideration of a project, please contact the appropriate contact SNC Area Representative and the Area Representative will assist the applicant to determine if the project meets SNC criteria.

It also adds a patron-driven collection development approach to a library’s usual process, resulting in a collection more closely matched to the needs of the local community.","About the Program  The Zip Books program is an alternative model for interlibrary loan service that bridges the gaps between a library’s patron request service, a normal acquisitions process, and an outreach/home delivery service. It is based on a project called “Zip Books—Digital Library of Northern California,” conducted by the Butte, Shasta, and Humboldt County Libraries under a FY 2011/12 LSTA grant from the California State Library. The Zip Books program is currently supported with California Library Services Act funds from the state of California.  Under the Zip Books program, patrons request books that the library does not own. The library then orders the book from Amazon, and the book is shipped directly to the patron’s home. When the patron is finished with the book, the book is returned to the library and added to the collection.  Eligibility and Funding Priority  Priority for funding the Zip Books program is as follows:-All libraries that have previously participated in the Zip Books program, and all libraries previously added to the waitlist for the Zip Books program, will have first priority.-All new requests for program participation from California public libraries will be considered if funds are available.  Grant AmountLibraries that have participated in the Zip Books program before will be allocated funds based on FY 2020/21 expenditures unless requesting a different amount in the Submittable application.

This program dedicates funding to local jurisdictions with the greatest needs to transition provisional licensees to annual licenses. The Grant Program is authorized by the Budget Act of 2021, Item 1115-101-0001 – For local assistance, found in Senate Bill 129 (2021).    The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (Act) contains specific timelines for when the Department can no longer issue or renew provisional licenses. Therefore, provisional license holders must complete the annual license process by certain dates or face a potential gap in licensure. Currently, approximately 75 percent of California’s commercial cannabis licenses are provisionally licensed.    Local jurisdictions eligible to receive grant funding represent those with significant numbers of provisional licenses who are legacy and equity applicants, and provisional licensees that are more likely to have arduous environmental compliance requirements associated with CEQA. The Grant Program is allocating $100 million on a one-time basis to aid local jurisdictions and their provisional licensees in completing CEQA compliance requirements necessary to achieve annual licensure. Grant Program funds may also be used to aid local jurisdictions in more expeditiously reviewing provisional licensee local requirements. Allowable uses are intended to encourage local jurisdictions to administer grant funds in ways that allow the Department to transition provisional licenses to annual licenses more expeditiously without sacrificing California’s environmental commitments.    Additional funding was allocated to those local jurisdictions that have received grant funding from the state to support an already established local equity program.

In addition, ESG funds may be used for associated Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) costs and administrative activities for some subrecipients.    The ESG program provides funding for the following objectives: • Engaging individuals and families experiencing homelessness. • Improving the quality of Emergency Shelters (ES) for individuals and families experiencing homelessness by helping to operate these shelters, and by providing essential services to shelter residents;• Rapidly re-housing individuals and families experiencing homelessness; and• Preventing families/individuals from becoming homeless. The funds are distributed in two separate funding pools: the CoC allocation and the Balance of State (BoS) allocation. Funding in the BoS allocation is made available based on recommendations from a CoC in two ways:    1. Through regional competitions within three geographic regions (Northern Region, Bay Area Region, Central and Imperial Valley Region) pursuant to California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 25 CCR 8404 (a) (3); and    2. Through a noncompetitive process for Rapid Re-Housing (RR) activities.

TAEP seeks to expand consulting and training to small businesses entrepreneurs. Funding is for new or enhanced consulting and training services to small businesses. Applicants must provide match funding in the form of federal or private funding to conduct technical assistance to small businesses. Please see RFP for more information.    Purpose    Small business technical assistance centers (“Centers”) are funded in part by federal and private agencies to operate small business support services and programs throughout the state. These Centers provide one-on-one, confidential consulting and training to help small businesses and entrepreneurs start, grow and expand, and create jobs in California. The SB TAEP provides state grant funding to create new or enhanced consulting and training services through existing and new Centers, including satellite offices. As the Program’s purpose is to expand offerings to California small businesses over a five-year period, annual requests may include continued support of new or enhanced expansion offerings created in previous years through TAEP.    Priorities    CalOSBA will prioritize funding for applications that best meet the factors listed in paragraph 1 (Government Code Section 12100-12100.69) and give preference to applications that propose new or enhanced services to underserved small business owners, including women, people of color and veteran-owned businesses and businesses in low-wealth, rural and disaster-impacted communities included in a state or federal emergency declaration or proclamation.    Eligible consulting and training services covered by the Program’s grant funding include: business plans and strategy; capital readiness and fundraising; expansion and revenue growth strategies such as export training, government and private procurement, e-commerce marketplace development and other business development strategies; marketing; management; operations; financial management; cybersecurity; production/manufacturing assistance and increased productivity strategies; innovation and tech transfer;  business resilience such as emergency preparedness, disaster economic recovery, succession planning; among other areas. Priority will be given to proposals that fill opportunity gaps for underserved small business owners to help them reach greater parity in revenue creation and job creation including capital readiness, export training and e-commerce, procurement, and other innovative programs that increase revenues and job creation to narrow the gap. Priority will also be given to business resilience programs for underserved small businesses which face increased challenges dealing with disaster recovery from natural, technological/cyber, health/disease, or human induced hazards. Business resilience may also include succession planning and exit strategies.","Nonprofit; Public Agency","Federally-awarded small business technical assistance programs in California, administered by and primarily funded by federal agencies, that provide one-on-one confidential free or low-cost consulting and training to small businesses and entrepreneurs in this state.  Small business technical assistance centers that possess private funding sources with a similar intent and that meet the criteria defined in subdivision (d) of Section 12100.62.",California,State,"The Program was enacted in Government Code Section 12100-12100.69.  In 2021, the program was expanded to include small business technical assistance centers that possess private funding sources with a similar intent and that meet the criteria defined in subdivision (d) of Section 12100.62.",100%,,"$17,000,000","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.","Dependant on number of submissions received, application process, etc.",Reimbursement(s),,"2021-07-20 07:00:00","2021-08-19 00:00:00","12 months","September 10, 2021","url: https://grants.business.ca.gov;",https://business.ca.gov/advantages/small-business-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/programs-and-initiatives/small-business-and-entrepreneurship-assistance-center-funding-opportunities/,https://business.ca.gov/advantages/small-business-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/programs-and-initiatives/small-business-and-entrepreneurship-assistance-center-funding-opportunities/,,,"name: Jean Coleman; email: sbtaep@gobiz.ca.gov; tel: 1-916-719-2212;","[{""fiscalYear"":""2021-2022"",""applicationsSubmitted"":""44""}]"

Protection of California’s forests through this program ensures they continue to provide such benefits as sustainable timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation opportunities, watershed protection and open space. Intact forests also contribute significantly to the storage and sequestration of carbon.  Working Forest Conservation Easements: Under this competitive grant program, CAL FIRE purchases or accepts donations of conservation easements or fee title of productive forest lands to encourage their long-term conservation. The primary tool CAL FIRE uses to conserve forest lands in perpetuity is permanent Working Forest Conservation Easements (WFCEs).  WFCEs do more than just restrict development and conversion on a property, WFCEs protect forest values by concentrating on sustainable forest practices that provide economic value from the land and encourage long-term land stewardship.","Eligibility: This program is entirely voluntary. Eligible properties include those with working forest and rangelands, where the property is managed for the production of forest products and traditional forest uses are maintained. Landowners who wish to participate may sell or transfer particular rights, such as the right to develop the property or to allow public access, while retaining ownership of the property and the right to use it in any way consistent with the terms of the easement and management plan.  Project Selection: Priority is given to lands that can be effectively protected and managed and that have important scenic, recreational, timber, riparian, fish and wildlife, threatened and endangered species, and other cultural and environmental values. CAL FIRE regularly partners with other funding agencies to select high value landscapes for conservation easement projects.

However, they have not been demonstrated in environments requiring greater capacity and reliability, such as during grid outages in emergency response. The lack of data on performance of these systems during critical needs, such as in power outages, is impeding their broader deployment. Demonstrations of system performance in different applications is needed to build confidence for their applications in emergencies.

Traditional workforce and education strategies have had inadequate impact. Even promising strategies lack the speed, agility, or scale needed to accelerate employment for workers desperately in need of good jobs    Accelerator seeks solutions to specific challenges that inhibit career opportunity & employment success for the targeted populations and that improve access to the workforce development pipeline – education, training, support services, placement, retention, etc. The intent is not simply to create new programs or to expand existing ones. Successful applicants will demonstrate how their projects will direct existing resources and efforts in new, more efficient and effective ways. These efforts should not create or reinforce service delivery silos or funding silos, but rather should result in strategies that take a new or unique approach to addressing workforce pipeline gaps specific to these populations, that can be applied, replicated or scaled to create broader impact and system improvement.    The Big Idea Concept The end game is advancing job quality and equity. Each project must identify a specific workforce system challenge or gap that existing workforce programs do not or cannot currently address due, for example, to rigid funding requirements, inadequate resources, need for relevant expertise or new partnerships, or other obstacles. With relatively flexible Accelerator funding, the Big Idea is a new innovative approach that has the potential to address this challenge or gap, thereby accelerating quality job outcomes for the population(s) targeted by the project.

The funds provided by this Program help to prepare the nation for the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to lives, property, and the environment in the United States.  EMPG provides funding to implement projects that enhance all-hazards preparedness and serve to build, sustain, and deliver 32 core capabilities across the five Mission Areas of the National Preparedness Goal (NPG). These Mission Areas, which are essential to the security and resilience of the nation, are Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery. The building, sustainment, and delivery of these core capabilities require the combined effort of the whole community, including public, private, and tribal entities.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVESThe purpose of this funding opportunity is to assist federally-recognized tribes in preparing for all hazards. The whole community approach is inclusive of local units of government, tribes, and nonprofit organizations, including partners at the state level. Statewide preparedness activities must address high-priority preparedness gaps across one or more of the 32 core capabilities. Funds provided under this Program must be used to support activities that effectively contribute to the tribe’s capability to prevent, prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from emergencies and disasters, whether natural or man-made.","Tribal Government","Eligibility:Restricted to federally-recognized tribes in California.

Senate Bill 100 (De León, 2018) establishes the goal of providing 100 percent of retail electric sales in California with renewable and zero carbon electricity by 2045. Preliminary analyses suggest achieving this target could require cumulative capacity additions of grid-connected battery storage in the range of 50 GW by 2045, much of which is expected to be provided by lithium-ion batteries. Simultaneous electrification of transportation will require even larger deployment of lithium-ion batteries in plug in electric vehicles (PEVs). Executive Order N-79-20 sets targets for 100 percent of passenger vehicles and trucks sold after 2035 to be zero emission as well as transitioning medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles to zero emission wherever feasible by 2045. The combined retirements of grid-connected stationary storage and PEV batteries reaching end-of-life will create a large potential electronic waste stream that needs to be sustainably managed.    Lithium-ion batteries from stationary storage and PEVs also have significant potential value at end-of-life for reuse and eventual recycling. Recycling and introduction of recovered materials into supply chains can reduce the need for virgin materials, thereby avoiding the environmental and social impacts associated with their production. Recycled materials may also substitute as lower cost feedstocks in the fabrication of new batteries, resulting in reduced purchase costs for batteries in PEVs and stationary storage applications. Establishing recycling expertise and capability within California creates opportunities for clean energy jobs and can contribute to the state’s economic development. Motivated by these potential benefits and the need to sustainably manage projected battery waste streams, Assembly Bill 2832 (Dahle, 2018) created the Lithium-ion Car Battery Recycling Advisory Group in 2019. The interagency group is consulting with researchers and other experts in battery recycling to develop policy recommendations for the Legislature to enable reuse and recycling of as close to 100 percent as possible of PEV battery waste at end-of-life.    This solicitation builds from previous investments to fund multidisciplinary applied research and development projects with the goals of: 1) improving lithium-ion battery direct recycling processes, 2) demonstrating pathways for incorporation of recycled materials into battery manufacturing, and 3) informing scale-up and future commercialization efforts to establish direct recycling capacity in California.          ","Business; Nonprofit; Public Agency","This solicitation is open to all public and private entities with the exception of local publicly owned electric utilities.

IMPROVING INPUT MANAGEMENT:  A. Demonstrating and/or Validating Management Practices that Optimize Nutrient and/or Irrigation Water Use Innovative management practices must be implemented on farms to promote agriculture sustainability and address agricultural challenges in California. Extension efforts that improve management practices and help implement efficient nutrient management practices on growers’ fields are a high priority.   B. Addressing Challenges and Barriers to Adoption of Management Practices A variety of money and time-saving management practices that improve environmental outcomes, with respect to N loss, are available; however, many of these practices have not been adopted on a large scale. Research focused on addressing barriers to widespread adoption of improved management practices could include:  C. Education and Outreach (Technical Education) The implementation of optimal irrigation and nutrient management practices depends on skilled and knowledgeable growers, managers, and field staff. Technical trainings and education can increase grower and field staff knowledge leading to improvements in on-farm management practices. Development of educational and/or certification programs to improve nitrogen and irrigation management are encouraged.  2. UNDERSTANDING PLANT-SOIL PROCESSES: A. Filling Knowledge Gaps for Nitrogen Management in Specific Crops  B. The Role of Organic Input Materials in Soil Nutrient Management Across California, organic materials are applied to agricultural soils to improve physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. More information on the plant-available nitrogen from organic sources is needed for management decisions, and to help growers estimate mineralization rates for nitrogen budgeting. These organic materials include, but are not limited to, wood chips from whole orchard recycling, nitrogen-containing soil amendments, and organic fertilizers.  3. LOSS PATHWAYS:  A. Understanding Nitrogen Movement from the Root Zone  B. Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Nitrogen Losses There are technologies and practices that may mitigate nitrogen losses via various loss pathways.

By itself, California’s $3.1 trillion gross domestic product (2019 GDP) places it fifth among the world’s largest economies. For 2019, the robust and growing industrial sector accounted for 10% of California’s GDP.    To produce the varied products and commodities that California is known for requires large quantities of energy and water. Available estimates indicate on an annual basis, California’s industrial sector accounts for over 25% of the state’s electricity consumption, 35% of its natural gas use, and is responsible for over 20% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).    California is also home to one of the largest and most unique water and wastewater infrastructure systems in the nation – delivering water and treating wastewater in farms, homes, and industries. Current estimates have California’s wastewater treatment plants treating approximately 4 billion gallons per day, with an annual energy consumption over 1,700 gigawatt-hours.    Given the scale of California’s IAW sectors’ energy usage, diversity, and significant contributions to California’s economy, it is vital to find solutions to help these sectors remain competitive in the global economy while helping to meet California’s ambitious energy efficiency and decarbonization goals set forth by SB32, SB100 and SB350.    The IAW sectors have significant potential for improvements in energy and water efficiency but are difficult sectors to promote energy efficiency and to decarbonize. Each sector and the individual facilities each have unique operational needs, have a mix of old and new equipment, lack easy access to actionable operation data for decision making and lack verified performance data under real-world conditions for promising emerging technologies.    The purpose of this solicitation is to fund technology development and demonstration projects of promising pre-commercial technologies to increase overall energy efficiency and reach statewide decarbonization goals set forth by SB 32, SB 100 and SB 350.

The research hub will engage stakeholders to advance high power charging systems and to plan, design, and deploy innovative corridor charging strategies that extend the range and increase the operational flexibility of battery electric trucks.","California has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improving air quality, and protecting the health of all Californians. The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in California and a major contributor to criteria pollutant emissions. Heavy-duty (HD) vehicles account for nearly 10 percent of the state’s GHG emissions and 26 percent of nitrogen oxides (NOx).To address these impacts, the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan established targets to improve freight efficiency, transition to zero-emission (ZE) technologies, and increase the competitiveness of California's freight system. Recently the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) Advanced Clean Trucks regulation established requirements for truck manufacturers to sell an increasing number of ZE trucks in California, potentially ramping-up to deploy over 300,000 ZE trucks between 2024 and 2035.    Replacing combustion-powered drayage trucks with ZE alternatives can greatly improve regional air quality, reduce health impacts on nearby communities, and reduce GHG emissions. However, drayage fleets beginning to adopt battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) face challenges related to understanding the performance and flexibility of BEV drayage trucks to meet their operational needs, and to installing necessary charging infrastructure in locations with limited physical space and electrical capacity. Although near-commercial BEV drayage trucks have sufficient range for many short haul operations with predictable return-to-base configurations, fleets may be reluctant to purchase BEVs that cannot flexibly cover all their routes. Variability in payload weight, driver behavior and conditions, and route characteristics create additional uncertainty in how fleet operators can incorporate BEV drayage trucks in real-world operations.    Battery-electric drayage trucks are only beginning to be evaluated through large-scale demonstrations and deployments.

The deadly and destructive fires of the past few years, as well as findings from California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, have highlighted the dire impacts expected from climate change on California if greenhouse gas emissions are not dramatically reduced. To avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, California has set aggressive policy goals to decarbonize its energy sector by 2045. Building decarbonization – primarily achieved through energy efficiency, onsite renewable generation and storage, and full end-use electrification – is a key strategy for realizing the state’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A number of California’s local governments are already pursuing ordinances that would require all new and existing buildings to be zero-emission by 2030 and 2050, respectively.    Through its research and development investments, the CEC has supported the development of a number of promising technologies that can help support the feasibility of a zero-emission mixed-use development. Many of the technologies have benefits beyond their energy and emission savings that can help facilitate their market adoption. For example, advancements in solid-state lighting and heat exchangers are enabling lighting and HVAC products in novel new form factors; potentially opening a new set of design options for architects to increase the aesthetic appeal and functionality of buildings. In addition, market actors and stakeholders are pursuing promising innovations in architecture, planning, policy, technology, construction, and financing. To address both greenhouse gas emissions and rising housing costs, technology and non-technology innovations across these sectors will need to come together into new models capable of disrupting the housing sector so that all Californians have access to safe, healthy, affordable, and desirable living environments.    This solicitation will be conducted as a two-phase design-build competition. The CEC may consider adding a third-phase grand prize challenge that will be awarded to the best of the four Build Phase projects to scale their design across the state. There is currently up to $12,000,000 available for the Design Phase portion of this solicitation. There is an additional $36,000,000 in funding available for the Build Phase of this competition contingent upon approval of the CEC’s 2021-2025 EPIC Investment Plan.

These centers provide wrap-around services and assist victims who are typically unserved and underserved communities.","The Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Grant funds organizations that operate throughout California to provide survivors of violent crime access to mental health or social services that may not be accessible for them through existing avenues. The TRC model offers wrap-around clinical services and cost-effective solutions for under- or un-served survivors and includes assertive outreach, clinical case management, assistance with law enforcement, referral to community resources and trauma-informed treatment. TRCs are meant to meet the victim where they are and serve each victim specific to his/her/their needs. Grant planning is not an eligible activity.  Funding for TRCs varies each year with $2,000,000 from the Restitution Fund and a percentage of savings from the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund (SNSF) that varies annually. SNSF totals have increased from $3.9 million in 2016 to $12.1 million in 2020. CalVCB typically receives 10-20 applications and awards 6-8 TRC grants. Individual awards vary by number of passing applications, funds available, and the amount requested to fund the TRC. Grants are for two fiscal years at a time, and TRCs may re-apply at the end of their awarded grant period to avoid a lapse in funding.  Each year, CalVCB posts a Notice of Funds Available (NOFA) that instructs how interested applicants may apply and what each application should include. Questions about the NOFA may be submitted and will receive a timely response within the application deadline. Due dates for the application will be included in the NOFA posting. TRCs must follow the May 2017 edition of the evidence-informed model of care developed by the State Pilot TRC, including a multidisciplinary staff that includes a Program Director, Psychologist, Psychiatrist and a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) or Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). Each TRC is expected to invoice quarterly (or monthly with approval), submit data reports quarterly and maintain records to fulfill site visit and/or audit requirements. Typical expenses for TRCs include:  Salary and benefits for personnel  Operating expenses related to direct services such as rent, insurance, utilities, postage, telephone service, internet costs, subcontractors, printed outreach materials  Emergency funds to help clients with nominal crime-related costs to meet the immediate needs of TRC clients such as transportation, childcare, food, emergency shelter, or clothing  Costs associated with community outreach events and activities  In-state travel costs for staff to perform eligible activities (Travel reimbursement varies according to the state policy in effect at the time the cost is incurred)  In-state training and conferences for the provision of trauma-informed evidence-based and evidence-informed practices as outlined in the grant application and approved in advance Indirect costs (your organization must have a pre-existing cost rate agreement)  The CalVCB Board reviews recommendations made and approves or denies the funding.

It is important for applicants to be aware that SB 1380 applies to the Adult Reentry Grant Program. As such, this will require applicants proposing projects that include housing or housing-related services to people experiencing homelessness or at-risk of homelessness to incorporate the core components of Housing First in their proposed program design.  Housing First is an approach to serving people experiencing homelessness that recognizes a homeless person must first be able to access a decent, safe place to live, that does not limit length of stay (permanent housing), before stabilizing, improving health, reducing harmful behaviors, or increasing income. Under the Housing First approach, anyone experiencing homelessness is connected to a permanent home as quickly as possible and Housing First programs remove barriers to accessing housing and do not require sobriety or an absence of criminal history. It is based on the “hierarchy of need” in which people must access basic necessities like a safe place to live and food to eat before being able to achieve quality of life or pursue personal goals. Housing First values choice not only in where to live, but whether to participate in services. For this reason, tenants are not required to participate in services to access or retain housing.  The statutory language authorizing the Adult Reentry Grant Program does not specify the types of Warm Handoff reentry services to be funded.

To achieve these goals the Department has adopted the following four objectives:    Identify activities which are needed for the conservation and maintenance of California's waterfowl habitat on public land.  Develop and fund project-specific strategies to protect, enhance, maintain or restore significant waterfowl habitat on public land.  Develop and fund project-specific strategies to conserve waterfowl populations.  Develop, administer, and fund a grants program for waterfowl conservation.","The California State Duck Stamp (Stamp Project) was created by legislation in 1971 (Fish and Game Code §3702). The stamp is required when hunting waterfowl and purchased by stamp collectors. All funds generated by the sale of stamps are deposited in the State Duck Stamp Account, administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Department). The funds can only be used for projects approved by the Fish and Game Commission (Commission) for the purpose of protecting, preserving, restoring, enhancing, and developing migratory waterfowl breeding and wintering habitat, evaluating habitat projects, and conducting waterfowl resource assessments and other waterfowl related research. These funds also may be used to reimburse nonprofit organizations for completed habitat projects.  During winter, wetlands and agricultural habitats in California, especially the Central Valley, support the largest single concentration of waterfowl (currently three to four million) in North America. This concentration represents more than 60 percent of all waterfowl wintering in the Pacific Flyway and more than 20 percent of all waterfowl wintering in North America. These birds are almost entirely dependent on water and habitat provided through human activities due to the significant loss of wetlands in California.  The goals of the Stamp Project, as described in legislation, are to protect, preserve, restore, enhance, and develop migratory waterfowl breeding and wintering habitat, evaluate habitat projects, and conduct waterfowl resource assessments and other waterfowl related research.

Projects could include, for example, land conservation for wildlife corridors, enhancement of bay area agriculture to increase carbon sequestration or protect farmworkers from extreme heat, or urban greening. Projects that use natural infrastructure and provide multiple benefits will be prioritized.    Tidal wetlands restoration projects will not be considered under this round, as there are ongoing funding sources at this time that are specifically for baylands restoration (for example, see the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority grant opportunities ;applications accepted in the fall of each year).

The Conservancy’s enabling legislation is Division 21 of the Public Resources Code, which can be found here. Division 21 authorizes the Conservancy to undertake projects and award grants to achieve the goals set forth in Division 21. The Conservancy works along the entire length of California’s coast, within the watersheds of rivers and streams that extend inland from the coast, and throughout the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.  The California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection, and Outdoor Access for All Act of 2018 (“Prop 68”) was approved by voters in June 2018. Prop 68 is codified as Division 45 of the Public Resources Code, Chapters 1-13, Sections 80000-80173. The purposes of Prop 68 include creating parks, enhancing river parkways, and protecting coastal forests and wetlands. Prop 68 also provides funding for outdoor access, lower cost coastal accommodations and climate adaptation. The Conservancy approved Proposition 68 Grant Guidelines in December 2018 and they can be found on our website here. These approved grant guidelines explain the funding priorities, project requirements, and project selection criteria for all Proposition 68 funds managed by the Conservancy, including the current solicitation.  Through Proposition 68, the Conservancy announces the availability of grant funds for the planning, design, permitting, and/or construction of projects in the Tijuana River Watershed that support the Tijuana River Border Pollution Control Project.  Conservancy staff are now soliciting pre-proposals for projects to be recommended for funding with the Proposition 68 appropriation for the Tijuana River Valley. For the current solicitation, the Conservancy has a total of $12,000,000 available: $8,813,000 for projects located in or benefiting Severely Disadvantaged Communities and $3,187,000 available for all other projects. Severely Disadvantaged Communities are defined as communities with a median household income less than 60% of the statewide average – see the Conservancy Proposition 68 Guidelines for more information.

Many of these children are nonverbal or otherwise unable to communicate if abused. The abuse and neglect rate for children with disabilities is higher due to their vulnerability and decreased likelihood that the perpetrator will be identified and prosecuted.    Currently, California has no legislative mandate for cameras on school transportation used by students with disabilities/special needs. Although some districts have independently implemented cameras, the cost of camera equipment and monitoring is a huge barrier and prohibits districts or local/county education agencies from moving forward.    Program Description    The SN Program is intended to provide cameras on school transportation used by pre-K through high school students with disabilities/special needs to identify abusive behavior that may occur between students and/or between students and bus drivers/school personnel.    Please note: Any school transportation identified as needing cameras under this Program must serve at least 75 percent of students with disabilities/special needs.     Program Components    a.

Eligible projects include those that reduce or eliminate discharges of subsurface agricultural drain water from the west side of the San Joaquin Valley for the purpose of improving water quality in the San Joaquin River and the Delta.4 PRC §75029(a) specifies that the reduction or elimination of subsurface agricultural drainage to the San Joaquin River should result in the reduction or elimination of salt, dissolved organic carbon, pesticides, pathogens, and other pollutants. Eligible proposals must include projects that will provide a public benefit (PRC §75004) and that will satisfy all other requirements of these Guidelines and PSP.    Examples of eligible projects include, but are not limited to, those that use drainage collection systems and water treatment technologies to reduce or eliminate drainage to the San Joaquin River from west side irrigators. Projects involving reuse of collected subsurface drainage water, water treatment projects targeting salinity and other constituent reduction, and implementation of BMPs may also be evaluated. Other types of eligible projects that meet the objectives of the prior paragraph will also be considered.","Public Agency","Eligible grant recipients are local agencies which have an eligible proposal/project(s) that will provide public benefit (PRC §75004) and which satisfy all other requirements of these guidelines, including but not limited to, minimum cost share requirements.","PRC § 75029 requires that funds will be available for eligible projects that improve water quality in the Delta, the San Joaquin River, and the Sacramento River.  DWR interprets this to mean the legal Delta, the San Joaquin River and tributary watershed downstream of major dams, and the Sacramento River and tributary watershed downstream of major dams.",State,"Proposition 84 (Safe Drinking Water, Water Quality and Supply, Flood Control, River and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2006; Cal.
